# MechaCar Statistical Analysis Report

## Background:

## Purpose:
The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the ability to: extract, transform, and load (ETL) data; visualize the data; and analyze the data using R. This includes tidyverse package contains libraries such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. These packages work together to help simplify the process of creating transformed data columns, grouping data using factors, reshaping our two-dimensional data structures, and visualizing our results using plots. Additionally, variety of statistical tests, their real-world application in data science, and their implementation in R. The goal is for you to apply these statistical concepts beyond this module, to any dataset, using any programming languageâ€”including Python.




## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
## Summary:

![]()
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
